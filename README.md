# Bachelor Thesis Source Repository

This repository contains the LaTeX sources for what will become my bachelor thesis.

## Building

Because I like Haskell and I've always wanted to try the build system `shake` building this requires the following programs be installed:

- PDFLaTeX
- The Haskell platform (GHC + cabal)
- The shake build system (`cabal install shake`)

This list may expand if more programs become necessary for compiling graphs and images.

Building the pdf is then simply a matter of running `./build.sh`.

### Preview

There is a preview of the compiled thesis pdf provided by the GitLab CI server. You can click on the latest (successful) build and use the download artefacts button.

## Timetable

- Begin working period: 31. May 2016
