  abstract = {The construction of structure-preserving maps, “homomorphisms”, is described for an arbitrary data type, and a “promotion” theorem is derived for proving equalities of homomorphisms. Examples are given for finite lists, tree structures and types defined by mutual induction; the construction is then dualised to data types with infinite objects, such as infinite lists. The promotion theorem allows the development of concise, calculational proofs: several examples are given of its application to program transformation.},
