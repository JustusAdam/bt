\chapter{If Transformation}

\label{ch:if-transformation}

\newcommand{\opite}{\texttt{ifThenElse}}
\newcommand{\opselect}{\texttt{select}}

The if construct in the Ohua framework, behaves like a curried function.
Input to the function is a boolean value and output is either the result of computing the true or the false branch.
Input values to the two conditional branches are curried from the outside.

\section{Transformation simplified}

We can apply a very similar method of decomposition as we did with smap.
To keep the transformation simple we assume both branches to have an equal number of fetches such that always two fetches, one from each branch, can be merged together.
If we merge one fetch from each branch we know that no matter the condition, exactly one of them is going to have input present.
Hence if we select whichever input is present and feed it to our single, merged fetch it is guaranteed to have input no matter the condition.
Afterwards we will ensure the output from \fetch{} is fed back into the continuation of the branch the input came from.

A simple demonstration of this transformation in Haskell code.
Both branches consist of calculations before the fetch and after the fetch and a fetch in between, see Figure \ref{fig:if-trans-code-before}.
In order to select the present input we first bundle the before calculations into their own if construct.
This construct now returns a request for our fetch independent of the condition.
We feed the request to fetch.
We use the same condition from before to select the appropriate continuation branch and call it with the value returned from the fetch, see Figure \ref{fig:if-trans-code-after}.
As with the smap transformation this simplified model ignores the fact that not every computation can be decomposed into \texttt{after . fetch . before}, however as in smap the transformation is still correct because we are in the land of dataflow.
In practice we only close the if or smap around the fetch itself and do not touch other parts of the graph.
This way we preserve as much data independence as possible, which leads to more opportunities for Ohua to parallelise.

\begin{verbatim}
if cond 
    then afterTrue  . fetch . beforeTrue 
    else afterFalse . fetch . beforeFalse
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
(if cond 
     then afterTrue 
     else afterFalse) 
. fetch 
. (if cond 
       then beforeTrue 
       else beforeFalse)
\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

We previously assumed that both branches held an equal number of fetches and that these could be paired up neatly in twos.
However in real programs this may not be the case at all, see Figure \ref{fig:if-trans-code-uneq-before}.
There is a simple solution to this problem.
We solve the imbalance of fetches by inserting empty (NoOp) fetches at the front of the branch with fewer fetches, see Figure \ref{fig:if-trans-code-uneq-inserted}.
Now we can apply the transformation as we did before, see Figure \ref{fig:if-trans-code-uneq-after}.
This might look like we're introducing unnecessary data dependencies through the empty fetch and slowing the execution of the else branch, however our dataflow engine will detect that \texttt{const} makes the \texttt{falseBranch} data independent from the result of the fetch and execute it none the less.
In fact the way \yauhau{} actually does this transformation the else branch will be connected only to the result of the first \opite{} operator and not at all to the result of the fetch.

if cond 
    then afterTrue . fetch . beforeTrue 
    else falseBranch

\begin{verbatim}
if cond 
    then afterTrue         . fetch . beforeTrue 
    else const falseBranch . fetch . mkEmptyRequest
\end{verbatim}
%(if cond then afterTrue else const falseBranch) . fetch . (if cond then beforeTrue else mkEmptyRequest)

     then afterTrue 
     else const falseBranch) 
. fetch 
. (if cond 
       then beforeTrue 
       else mkEmptyRequest)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Transformation in operators}

More concretely \texttt{if} is composed of a starting node called \opite{} and an end node called \opselect{}, see Figure \ref{fig:basic-if}.
The \opite{} operator takes as its input the boolean value and depending on the value activates one of its two outputs.
Outputs from the \opite{} operator are connected via an activation arc to the first operator(s) of each of the respective conditional branches.
The computed output from the conditional branches are both fed to the \opselect{} operator which returns a value whenever one of its inputs receives one.

\end{figure}

To close out our fetch from the if we replace the original two fetches with a select operator, receiving both their inputs and feeding into a single fetch.
The output from this fetch is fed back to \textbf{both} continuation branches.
Any location that used either fetch result now receives the result of the combined fetch.
This might seem wrong, however we use a new \opite{} to only select one of the two branches for execution, therefore only the originally selected branch also continues with its execution.
