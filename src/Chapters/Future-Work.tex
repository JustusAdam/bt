\section{Formalised rewrite rules}

Rewrite rules as applied by both the context unrolling and the batching transformation are not formally verified to be correct.
An aim of future work in this direction, not just from \yauhau{} but the Ohua system in general could be the formulation of a core set of program rewrites, primitives, which are then verified to be correct.
Subsequently the transformations as described in Chapters~\ref{ch:if-transformation},~\ref{ch:smap-transformation} and~\ref{ch:Yauhau} could be described in those abstract terms and verified to be correct and semantics preserving.
We have found inspiration for this in a paper ``Generating Performance Portable Code Using Rewrite Rules: From High-level Functional Expressions to High-performance OpenCL Code''\cite{Steuwer:2015:GPP:2858949.2784754}, where formally verified rules are used to decompose and transform high-level functional expressions.
